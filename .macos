# Mac OS X configuration

# This configuration applies to the latest version of macOS (currently 11.3),
# and sets up preferences and configurations for all the built-in services and
# apps. Third-party app config should be done elsewhere.

# Options:
#   --no-restart: Don't restart any apps or services after running the script.
#
# If you want to figure out what default needs changing, do the following:
#
#   1. `cd /tmp`
#   2. Store current defaults in file: `defaults read > before`
#   3. Make a change to your system.
#   4. Store new defaults in file: `defaults read > after`
#   5. Diff the files: `diff before after`
